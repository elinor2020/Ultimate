Ultimate is interested in predicting rider retention. The Ultimate company have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an Ultimate account in January 2014. The data was pulled several months later; the Ultimate company consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days.
